# Welcome

On this website, you will see pages that reflect the labs for Chapters 1-6 from "DevOps for Data Science" by Alex Gold. Please note, you will only see the code for Chapter 1 due to technical errors with R and Python code. You can see my files and work in my GitHub folders where everything is commented out as I did all the work and then the code stopped working.
